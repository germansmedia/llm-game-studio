# DAY 0

## Introduction

The objective is to build a game development studio entirely populated by simple, locally running, LLMs. I'm treating this through the lense of electrical/process engineering, and general experience with teams of people trying to be creative. I'm assuming that LLMs can be used for "very basic agents that can accomplish anything". The big questions are related on how to manage these agents and make them collaborate effectively to achieve building video games. This is generally achieved by doing many tiny experiments.

### Research questions

These questions need answering, initially as quickly as possible, and when deemed necessary, with greater detail.

#### About the Technical Setup

- __Running One or More Servers__: Run a server locally? What models are there? Which models seem most useful? Can we hotswap the entire project on different models to see the difference?

	The answer is LMStudio for now. Start it in the background, and then use python to access the currently loaded model via HTTP request.

- __Agents__: The studio is populated by agents. What exactly are these agents? How can they be described? Saved/loaded? How to prompt a specific agent? Can an agent have their own quirks? Are there agent types? What elementary tasks can be found? Does the type come down to prompt engineering? Can this be represented via graphs?

- __Memory and State__: What sort of state is there for an agent? Can state be prompted? Can an LLM be used to simulate multiple functions? How can agents reliably hold memory/context? Can they interpret JSON or text data? What is a good common communication format?

- __The Coding Itself__: Can LLMs program and craft the entire thing? Can really the entire process be automated by LLMs, what does a basic framework look like?

- __Learning__: Can agents learn things? Is it possible to improve them? Is it possible to derive metrics from the effectivity of these agents?

#### About the Collaboration of Multiple Agents

- __Collaboration__: What types of collaboration are there? Is it possible to make LLMs stronger by combining their efforts in parallel? In series? Top/down? Bottom/up? etc.
- __Internal Optimization__: How can LLMs be optimized for their tasks? How can they learn? What kind of prompt engineering is needed?
- __Integration__: How can LLMs communication optimally among each other? Can LLMs hold meetings? Are there any common processing elements in these meetings?
- __Decisions__: How can LLMs make decision? What constitutes of decision making? Can a "judge-LLM" be used for meta-decisions? How can decisions be recorded?
- __Human Interfaces__: How can humans help here? Can humans be judges of information? Can humans be part of the process somehow?

#### About the Content of The Games

- __Architecting the Studio__: What tasks are there in game development? How can these be sensibly done by LLMs? What factory architecture makes sense? How can one design such an architecture? What data is stored about a game?
- __Story Development__: What steps are there to develop a compelling story with LLMs that result in interesting gameplay? How can characters be generated? How can drama be represented? What about the hero's journey?
- __Characters__: How can LLMs collaborate to reliably generate character profiles, sprite sheets, movement basics, etc.
- __Maps__: How can LLMs collaborate to reliably generate maps that represent the story? 
- __Music__: Can LLMs compose compelling music that supports the story and the action that takes place?
- __Sideways Input__: Can director/overseer LLMs be used to inject information sideways about style, tone, themes, art, etc.?

#### About Playing and Feedback

- __Fun__: Are the generated games fun and interesting? What is not? What could be done differently?
- __Feedback__: How can human/player feedback be inserted in the architecture? Can this be done sideways?

#### About Marketing, Publication and Monetization

- __Marketing__: Can LLMs do the entire marketing for a game? What architecture would be needed for this?
- __Monetization__: In what way would this be monetizable? Can In-game purchases be a thing? Are there events to present this at?

> I am researching how to build a system of LLM agents that collaborate to build a simple 1980s top-down JRPG entirely by themselves. Please give a bullet list of research questions.

Great project! To help you with your research, here are some potential research questions related to building an AI system of LLM agents for creating a 1980s top-down JRPG:

1. How can we design an effective communication protocol between the LLM agents to enable seamless collaboration and decision-making?

	* What are the best ways to share information, resources, and goals among the agents?
	* How can we handle conflicting opinions or uncertain predictions among the agents?

2. How can we train the LLM agents to play the game in a way that is both fun and challenging for players?

	* What are the key features of a 1980s top-down JRPG that we should prioritize when training the agents?
	* How can we balance the difficulty level of the game to keep players engaged while still providing a challenge?

3. How can we enable the LLM agents to create a cohesive and engaging storyline for the game?

	* What are the key elements of a compelling narrative that the agents should prioritize when creating the story?
	* How can we handle the creative freedom of the agents while still ensuring a consistent and cohesive story?

4. How can we design the game's graphics, sound effects, and music to complement the LLM agents' decision-making process?

	* What are the key elements of an immersive gaming experience that the agents should prioritize when designing the game's aesthetics?
	* How can we ensure that the audio and visual aspects of the game are aligned with the agents' decision-making processes?

5. How can we evaluate the performance of the LLM agents in creating a 1980s top-down JRPG?

	* What metrics should we use to measure the success of the agents in their task?
	* How can we balance the need for evaluation and the importance of preserving the agents' creativity and autonomy during the game development process?

6. How can we ensure that the LLM agents are able to learn from their experiences and improve over time?

	* What are the key factors that influence an agent's ability to learn and adapt in a game development context?
	* How can we design the game's systems and mechanics to facilitate the agents' learning and improvement?

7. How can we ensure that the LLM agents are able to work together effectively as a team?

	* What are the key elements of effective teamwork in a multi-agent system?
	* How can we design the game's objectives, rewards, and penalties to promote collaboration among the agents?

8. How can we ensure that the LLM agents are able to handle unexpected events and challenges during the game development process?

	* What are the key strategies for handling surprise or uncertainty in a multi-agent system?
	* How can we design the game's systems and mechanics to facilitate flexible and adaptive decision-making among the agents?

9. How can we ensure that the LLM agents are able to evaluate their own performance and make improvements based on their own self-assessment?

	* What are the key elements of self-awareness and self-evaluation in a multi-agent system?
	* How can we design the game's systems and mechanics to facilitate self-reflection and self-improvement among the agents?

10. How can we ensure that the LLM agents are able to generate new ideas and solutions during the game development process?

	* What are the key elements of creativity and innovation in a multi-agent system?
	* How can we design the game's systems and mechanics to facilitate divergent thinking and idea generation among the agents?

## Notes

Agents might have types.

One type can be tasked with adding colorful details to a simple description.

One type can be tasked with extracting character descriptions from a story.

One type can be tasked with designing sprite sheets from a description.

...

Maybe there is an open source flow graph editor framework somewhere?
