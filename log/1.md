# DAY 1

After a lot more reading and learning about prompt engineering, a first draft of a story engine appears. Tried to generate simple stories related to objects and themes, and also to extend these stories to chunks that can be processed into parts of the game.

One strategy is to start out with a given theme, find a couple of objects related to this theme, and then generate a story and characters. The story can have a semi-fixed structure, so the different tasks in generating the story become smaller and simpler, and perhaps easier to manipulate.

It turns out that the outputs differ a lot and are very difficult to wrangle into json or string lists for further processing. The LLM needs a bunch of tools to massage the outputs back into usable data. Something to think about tomorrow.

Some ideas on wrangling tools or operators:

- ensure output is an array of one-word strings
