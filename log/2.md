# DAY 2

Wrangling the LLM output isn't as easy as expected, but it works a little bit now. There is a need for single word or concept answers, as well as one-sentence elaborations. For things like characters, objects, etc. you want to have a single word to identify them, and then a small sentence to guide the flavor when priming other prompts.

Tried a few libraries. `guidance-ai` seems promising, also allowing for better shoehorning and json generation.
