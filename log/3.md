# DAY 3

Had some interesting ideas on how to have the AI actually write good stuff. So you define a ranking function to compare stories with each other on different metrics.

## Judging Creativity (```judge1```)

In this experiment, we generate a bunch of characters and generate random themed sentences for different parts of a story. Then randomly mix together these sentences into different stories. And finally judge which story is funniest, most interesting, etc.

From the results it's clear that randomly concatenating sentences does not work. Due to this, the quality of the judgements is dubious.

## Judging Creativity 2 (```judge2```)

Another idea is to grow out stories by guided instructions, and then later compare them with each other to find the best one.

Generated stories:
```
    Lily stared up at the neon lights of Nathan Road, uneasy thoughts swirling through her mind as she awaited Richard's arrival. Suddenly, the sound of rapid footsteps behind her made Lily spin around, only to find nothing but an empty alleyway. Lily suddenly heard footsteps behind her and turned around, only to find a cloaked figure standing in the shadows of the alleyway, his hand reaching for a knife. Alexander stepped out of the darkness, revealing himself to Lily with a sinister smile. With a flash of instinct, Lily ducked and kicked the axe out of Alexander's hand, allowing her to overpower him and call for help.

    Lily stood on the balcony at the Ritz Carlton overlooking the glittering harbor, the cool evening air whispering to her through the trees. Suddenly, a figure appeared from the darkness behind her. As she turned around, she saw Richard standing there. It was then that Lily realized Richards betrayal and the truth about Alexanders involvement. Alexander stepped out from the shadows with a smirk, revealing himself as the mastermind behind the entire scheme, leaving Lily to ponder the depths of deceit and deceitful motives in the seemingly perfect world of Hong Kong.

    Lily watched as Richard and Alexander approached the dimly lit alleyway, their faces hidden in the shadows. However, as they drew closer, Lily couldn't ignore the feeling of unease gnawing at her. As they reached for their weapons, Lily knew it was time to act. With a fierce determination, Lily lunged forward, her blade flashing in the dim light, ready to protect herself and those she loved. In a whirlwind of action and chaos, Lily managed to disarm and incapacitate the two men, leaving the alleyway a bloodied but victorious survivor.

MOST DRAMATIC:
    Lily watched the sunrise from the balcony of her penthouse, the city lights flickering below, unaware that her life was about to change dramatically. Meanwhile, Richard, a renowned businessman, was making strategic plans with Alexander, his trusted confidant, for an ambitious project. The unknown visitor knocking on the door sent shivers down Lily's spine as she hesitated to answer. It was Alexander, with a smug expression and a gun in his hand, who stood before her, revealing his true intentions. Caught off guard, Lily's desperate pleas for mercy were overshadowed by the deafening gunshot that echoed through the room, signaling the beginning of her darkest night.

    Lily, a local artist, looked up as the dim sun began to seep through the layers of smog, revealing the towering skyscrapers of Hong Kong. However, as Richard, her American patron, approached from behind, her expression darkened and her heart raced, for she knew Alexander, her former lover and rival, had arrived in the city as well. Alexander's arrival had put an unsettling tension in the air, threatening to disrupt the delicate balance Lily had worked so hard to maintain. Richard looked on, unaware of the simmering tension that existed between the two artists. Lily couldn't believe her eyes when she saw Alexander, with his arm around another woman, in the very same gallery where she was exhibiting her latest work. Lily's heart ached as she watched him, wondering if she could ever truly let go of the past and move on, or if she was destined to be trapped in a never-ending cycle of pain and regret.

    Lily stood on the balcony of her penthouse, overlooking the bustling city of Hong Kong, a sense of unease settling in her stomach asshe watched Alexander and Richard, two of her business partners, exit her office, deep in conversation. Lily couldn't help but feel a pang of fear as she watched them leave, wondering what they could be plotting behind her back. As she continued to watch them, she saw them turn a corner and disappear from sight, leaving her alone with her thoughts. As she turned her head, she saw a shadowy figure standing in the corner of the balcony, watching her intently. Realizing it was just the gardener, she took a deep breath and returned to her seat inside, her fear momentarily subsided but her unease remaining.

MOST SENSIBLE:
    Lily couldn't believe her eyes as Richard and Alexander walked into the bustling market, each carrying a large bag filled with valuable jade stones. Lily rushed forward, excitement bubbling within her. She asked them where they had found such a large number of beautiful jade stones. They smiled and revealed that they had discovered a hidden cave deep in the jungle, where jade stones were abundant. Lily's heart raced with excitement and wonder as they shared stories of their adventures and planned their next journey together, the three friends united in their passion for discovering the hidden treasures of Hong Kong's lush jungles.

FUNNIEST:
    The air thick with the scent of jasmine and herbal tea, Lily eyed Richard and Alexander across the small round table at the chic tea house nestled among the verdant hills of the Peak District in Hong Kong. Lily, with a sudden surge of anger, pushed her teacup aside and accused them both of conspiring against her. The subdued murmurs of the other patrons grew louder and more discernible with each sharp word Larry hurled at her accusers. Lily could no longer keep her anger in check as the two men continued to deny any involvement in the betrayal. The truth was finally revealed, leaving Alexander and Richard stunned and Lily with a renewed determination to take control of her own destiny.

Boris, who had spent his entire life working the land, was now ready to leave it all behind and start anew in the big city. Together, Boris, Wendy, and Lola embarked on an adventure filled with passion, excitement, and endless possibilities.

## Discussion

These stories, however, are still very small scale. The current technique could work very well for small scenes, but not for overaching stories.

Following that route, this means we'd need an overarching story system that preps the existing generator. One idea is to create a global 'journey' for each character around a certain theme. In that context it would also matter what role the character plays in an overarching story. One character can be the inciting character, one character is the protagonist, one is the evil villain, etc. So the substrate of this overarching story system is much more abstract. Not sure if an LLM is capable of this at sufficient levels.

Another idea is a top-down approach, in that one creates "opera templates" by hand (basically like Chronicle Commander) that describe arcs for each character, and then let the LLM fill in the scenes for each point. This would also make it easier to start blocking and analyzing the scene in the design process further down the road. However, these "templates" are artworks within themselves, and the question becomes, how to generate such arcs? Is the LLM capable of reasoning at more abstract levels to lay down a meta story that can be analyzed? What questions can we ask it to guide arc generations? Maybe use a noise function to generate data from which the arc can be sampled. Define a certain parameter set and corresponding word strings to match the levels of the parameters, and then sample actual arcs in these parameters into mood primers for the story generator.

Such a technique might also work to seed conversations between characters. Like, totally an LLM would be able to simulate the conversation, but priming the prompts for that is where the real magic happens...

A third idea is a hybrid of the two. Can bottom-up generate initial settings for a noise function, which then top-downs a deeper story... That one sounds very far away, still.

What can help here maybe is realizing that each story needs certain elements. A character needs to be introduced, character's relationships need to be introduced, an overall activity needs to be planned out, and interacted with, etc. and it should be done abstractly.

So an interesting experiment could be: can we instruct the LLM to generate a scene with a lot of meta information like "Make sure {name} gets introduced here."

In general, it's probably a good idea to focus on generating scenes with meta information, perhaps based on a simple sentence.

And then on the judging part. There are some spot-on examples in the above runs of where the LLM was able to really catch the meanings of these stories (mostly with the moniker "saddest"), let's keep trying other judgements, it seems a good indication of what to choose from the sets, is the one with the most "oscars", so to say.

Story:
    Jack ordered a beer, trying not to think about his family's expectations for the upcoming holiday season.
    Suddenly, the door swung open and in walked Detective Hank McFarland, his coat dripping wet from the storm outside.
    Jack felt a shiver run down his spine as Detective McFarland approached him.
    Detective McFarland glanced around the room before settling on Jack and asking him a question.
    It was then that Jack realized the importance of making a difference, no matter how small, during the holiday season.
    Jack bought a coat for a homeless man, warming both their spirits on this cold Christmas Eve.
    Detective McFarland smiled, impressed by Jack's act of kindness, and bought him another beer as a token of appreciation.

Full Story:
    With the holiday season upon us, the bar was decked out in red and green, the atmosphere laced with a tangible air of festivity. Jack, huddled in a corner stool, ordered a beer, trying not to think about his family's expectations for the upcoming Christmas. The bartender set down a fresh mug of eggnog in front of Jack, a knowing smile playing on his lips. The bartender, sensing Jack's mood, offered him a free glass of eggnog to help lighten it up. Jack sighed deeply, the warmth of the eggnog and the holiday cheer starting to seep in.

    Amidst the cheerful clamor of jingling bells and holiday trivia quiz, the dimly-lit bar was stuck in a seasonal time warp. The mellow glow of the Christmas lights cast a comforting hue over the patrons, who were huddled around their glasses of warm eggnog, swapping stories about the old times. Detective McFarland scanned the room, familiar faces and Christmas carols in the background. Detective McFarland's arrival caused a momentary pause in the holiday revelry. Before anyone could ask, he held up a wet, crumpled envelope and simply said, 'Someone left this for me.'

    The snow was coming down in thick flakes, blanketing the already-white landscape as Jack took a deep breath of the wintry air. You're under arrest for murder, Jack, Detective McFarland's icy blue eyes bore into Jack's soul as he read the rights. Jack's heart sank as the reality of the situation hit him.

    The dimly lit bar, the only source of warmth in the frigid December evening, was filled with the mingled sounds of laughter and clinking glasses. It's almost midnight and Santa's sleigh is due any minute. Detective McFarland, drained from long hours of questioning suspects, leaned back in his chair and sighed heavily. As Jack looked up from his drink, McFarland's questioning gaze locked onto him.

    The clinking of martini glasses filled the air as the twinkling lights of the Christmas tree cast an ethereal glow over the dimly lit room. Amid the merriment, Jack felt a familiar pang of loneliness settle in his chest. Suddenly, the door burst open, and a gust of wind and snow sent a shiver down Jack's spine. As if on cue, the bartender poured Jack another drink. Jack looked up from his drink and saw an elderly woman huddled in the doorway, her eyes filling with tears as she struggled to make it inside from the storm.

    The soft, glowing lights of the holiday season cast long, dancing shadows across the crowded bar. The bartender poured Jack another drink, smiling as she noticed the coat hanging by the door. Just then, Jill entered, shivering from the cold. Seeing Jill's discomfort, Jack reached for his wallet and bought a coat for the homeless man waiting outside, warming both their spirits on this cold Christmas Eve.

    The thick fogthat blanketed the narrow streets of Dixie's winter night seemed to feed off the holiday cheer that clung to the town like a cozy blanket. Amid the Christmas lights and holly wreaths that adorned every window, Detective McFarland exited the police station, ready to face a night of potential chaos.  Suddenly, the sound of jingle bells rang through the bar, and everyone turned to see Jack leading a reindeer inside. As McFarland approached the bar, he couldn't help but feel a odd sense of warmth and gratitude toward Jack. The detective ordered a glass of eggnog and joined Jack in a moment of holiday camaraderie.

Ok, top-down expanding a short story just by simple prompting seems like a dead end. We should try a noise generator, and maybe ask a lot of 'why'..
