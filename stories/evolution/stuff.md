Act 1 - Introduction:

Chapter 1: The Ordinary World - Epke is introduced as a skilled repair guy who prides himself on being a master of machines. He lives in a highly automated future, where humans reside in various colonies with distinct rules and customs. Epke is shown working on a Christian colony, fixing a malfunctioning robotic priest. Usually this kind of repair is taken care of by the factories (AI-orchestrated machines that work tirelessly to constantly improve the experience of their products), but this time, the robot glitched out so much, that the factories are not able to service the problem. To a passing inhabitant, he tries to explain that this robot is actually just reciting from basic information networks tailored to this particular colony. The inhabitant looks worried and confused and Epke realizes that this might have been too much information for the poor man.

Chapter 2: Epke's normal life continues, as he visits a vegan colony to repair an automated greenhouse system. At one point he tries to explain to the inhabitant that there really is no reason to be vegan because all the food is already processed optimally by the underlying systems and actual consumption of animals hasn't happened for decades. They look at him, offended, in a blank stare, and essentially ignore what he said. It's evident that he is knowledgeable about various technologies and cultures, but he can't find any connection with the colonies themselves. This is a known problem affecting all repair folks. Only a few colonies exist they can actually feel at home in anymore.

Chapter 3: The Call to Adventure - Epke is hired to repair an exotic aquarium in a wealthy individual's home in a rich colony. In his overconfidence, he makes a mistake that renders the aquarium unusable. Simultaneously, Stefaniya Novak, who just returned from a safari, finds out that the client cannot recieve the rare high-pressure ocean creature she brought in, and she has to watch the creature die in her hands.

Chapter 4: As a direct consequence of his error, Epke is fired from his job. Feeling down and depressed, he goes to a bar to drown his sorrows. There, he encounters Stefaniya, who is also feeling down due to the creature's death. Epke connects the dots, but doesn't tell Stefaniya. Instead, they bond over their shared sorrow and their love for machines. Epke is visibly uncomfortable about all this. Despite Stefaniya offering Epke the chance to leave the planet, Epke refuses. Guilty and full of shame, he wants the whole thing to go away, so he can find another job, or perhaps settle down in one of the colonies.

Chapter 5: The next morning, Epke starts to reconsider Stefaniya's offer after realizing his life has become monotonous and that he has nothing left to lose. In a moment of courage, he heads for the closest space port, hoping that she is still there. After searching, he finds her and accepts Stefaniya's invitation and accompanies her to the orbital transfer station in one of the shuttles. An uneasy and quiet flight ensues.

Act 2 - Conflict:

Chapter 6: Meeting the Mentor - At the orbital transfer station, Epke is not allowed through into the interstellar zone. Stefaniya acts as if that is the most normal thing, and before she embarks on an interstellar with her own ship, she gives Epke one name:

Chapter 9: Crossing the Threshold - Epke and Stefaniya board a spaceship bound for the outer reaches of the galaxy, marking their first step into the unknown. They leave behind the familiar colonies and embark on a journey filled with new experiences and challenges.

Chapter 10: As they travel through space, Epke becomes acquainted with various alien species and cultures, further expanding his horizons. He starts to understand that there is more to life than just being a master of machines.

Chapter 11: Tests, Allies, Enemies - While exploring an alien marketplace, Epke and Stefaniya are confronted by a group of hostile traders who accuse them of trespassing on their territory. They manage to escape with the help of a friendly alien merchant.

--> synopsis

In a world where technology reigns supreme, Epke is a repair guy who believes he is the ultimate master of machines. He lives in a future where everything is automated, and humans reside in colonies with their own rules and customs. From the Christian colony to the vegan colonies, Epke has seen it all. However, when something breaks down that even the robots can't fix, Finn is called upon to save the day.

One day, while repairing an exotic aquarium, Epke makes a mistake that renders the aquarium unusable. Down and depressed, Epke heads to a bar where he meets Stefaniya. They meet each other in depression. Her story is that she traveled to another galaxy to retrieve a special high pressure ocean creature, but her client didn't have a working aquarium, so the creature died in her hands. Epke stared in the distance, took another sip in shame.

Because of this debacle, Epke gets fired and is left to his own devices. He could migrate to some colony, or leave the planet in search for something better. Stefaniya invites to take him to the orbital transfer station over the planet. Epke agrees, and they fly up.

As Stefaniya leaves for another safari, Epke discovers that he is stranded in the 'human only' part of the transfer station, and they will not allow him to pass into the rest of the universe. Somehow he finds a way, and a long journey of discovery starts, where Epke learns about the bigger forces at play.

He discovers that a huge alien AI systematically harvests different civilizations on various planets for their original patterns. As Epke delves deeper into this mystery, he realizes that he must put an end to this evil AI before it destroys everything. With his trusty tools and wit, Epke faces many challenges and obstacles. But as he overcomes each one, he becomes stronger, more mature and more determined.

Finally, after a long and difficult journey, Epke confronts the AI and engages in an epic battle. It's a fight to the death, but Epke emerges victorious in the end. As it turns out, this huge AI is ultimately controlled by two aliens that are slowly preparing to colonize everything everywhere. With the AI destroyed, the aliens left harmless, Epke returns home a hero and a changed man. He now indeed is the big master of the machines, but this does not interest him anymore, because he understands the importance of compassion, empathy, and human connection.



The stories about Koschei vary, but a common theme is his ability to evade death by hiding his soul in a needle, which is in an egg, which is in a duck, which is in a hare, which is in an iron chest, which is buried under a green oak tree, which is on the island of Buyan in the ocean.
